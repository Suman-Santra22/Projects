        <strong>Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI)</strong>, previously known as <strong>PUBG Mobile India</strong>, is a version of PUBG Mobile developed specifically for the Indian market by Krafton. It is an online multiplayer battle royale game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was initially released on 2 July 2021 for Android devices, and on 18 August 2021 for iOS devices. As of July 2022, BGMI surpassed 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store. The game was banned in India on July 28, 2022, by the Indian government. According to a statement from Krafton, the ban was removed on May 26, 2023.

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        Battlegrounds Mobile India is a battle royale game where up to 100 players compete in a large-scale last man standing deathmatch. Players can enter the match as individuals or as small groups of up to four.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of several maps. Players begin with no equipment and must search buildings and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armor, and other items. The playable area shrinks over time, forcing players into closer quarters and increasing the likelihood of encounters.
      </p>
      <h2>Developement</h2>
      <p>
        On 2 September 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of the Government of India banned PUBG Mobile, along with 117 Chinese applications, citing activities that were prejudicial and a threat to India's sovereignty, integrity, defence, state security, and public order under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

It was reported in November 2020 that PUBG Mobile would be relaunched in India under the name PUBG Mobile India. On 24 November 2020, The Times of India reported that PUBG Studios and South Korea's video game company Krafton had registered PUBG India Private Limited under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India in order to relaunch PUBG Mobile in India.

It was reported in May 2021 that PUBG Mobile would be rebranded as Battlegrounds Mobile India in order to enter the Indian gaming market. Following that, The Indian Express reported on 7 May 2021 that Krafton confirmed in a press statement that they were going to launch Battlegrounds Mobile India, a game similar to PUBG Mobile.
      </p>
      <h2>Release</h2>
      <p>
        The game was announced on 6 May 2021. The pre-registrations of the game started for Android users on 18 May 2021 and early access beta version of the game was released on 17 June 2021 only for Android users. The game released on 2 July 2021 for Android devices,[11] and on 18 August 2021 for iOS devices.
